- 👋 Hi, I’m @SusanSnee
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Excel and writing effective chatGPT prompts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how Git and Github work.
- 💞️ I’m exploring new horizons and attempting to keep my brain from turning to mush.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is by text to 601-600-7633. Be sure to tell me why you want to reach me. I'm kind of selective in returning texts.
